    <h2>Your Special Holiday Meaning</h2>
    <p> Christmas time is special to me because it was my first US holiday ever, we celebrated it about a month after we landed here and everything was so pretty, there were lights and trees everywhere and we didn't celebrate chrismas like this in Dubai so it was very new to me and at first I didn't understand the point of the gifts, trees and all the lights but over the past 3 years it's become my favorite time of the year.</p>
